                   Monsoonal Multiplicities is an exhibition project that brings together texts, maps, photographs and videos generated by Monsoon  Assemblages researchers during their five-year intra-action with the monsoon in south and south east Asia. It offers visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon as a multiplicity of entangled beings, energies, infrastructures, lifeworlds, matters, technologies and knowledge practices. It is organized in five rooms - <u> framings, infrastructures, interspecies interlocuters, matters and urban assemblages</u> – that serve as agential cuts through monsoonal encounters. The website has been designed to enable visitors to navigate rhyzomically through these rooms - to scroll down, leap across,  return, zoom in, pause, or in other ways intra-act with the material without ever having to return to a home page. Navigation becomes a way of constructing constitutive interrelations across difference, providing an embodied virtual experience of the multiplicitous monsoon.

                      Known as ilish in Bengali, hilsa are a monsoonal
                      species. They inhabit the entire coastline of the Indian
                      Ocean, but they are most abundant in the upper
                      reaches of the Bay of Bengal. At the apex of the Bay
                      immense monsoonal flows merge with ocean currents
                      and tides creating a unique ecosystem. While hilsa
                      spend most of their life in the Bay they migrate to the
                      rivers of the delta to breed. The rains of the south‐west
                      monsoon act as an ecological trigger, initiating their
                      spawning migration. Hilsa used to migrate to the upper
                      reaches of all the major rivers, but in recent times their
                      range has dramatically reduced. The altered mobilities
                      of the hilsa are an indicator of shifting human-nonhuman relations

                Fishers from the Meghna River ascribe changing hilsa
                migration patterns to the inhospitable river environment.
                The Farakka Barrage, commissioned in 1975 by the
                Indian government, transformed Bangladesh’s rivers.
                The barrage reduced the velocity of monsoonal flows
                leading to siltation and sedimentation downstream,
                restricting hilsa movements. Fishers are also concerned
                by illegal sand mining, fuelled by Dhaka’s booming
                construction industry. Flotillas of sand dredgers vacuum
                gravel and sand from the river, altering its bathymetry
                and disturbing fish migration routes. In response to
                changing hilsa movements, fishers are forced deeper
                into the turbulent Bay of Bengal.

          In recent decades, rapid urbanization and the increased purchasing power of the urban middle class has led to greater fish consumption. Increased demand for the “queen of fish” resulted in unsustainable fishing practices with hilsa numbers declining from the 1970s onwards, reaching record lows in the early 2000s. Alarmed by diminishing numbers and changes to migration patterns, scientists mobilised to conserve the species. To curb unsustainable fishing, and regulate supply to urban markets, scientists developed annual ban periods to “save mother hilsa”.

        Hilsa is cooked in a myriad of ways, but knowing how to buy hilsa is an essential part of the cooking process. Not all hilsa are the same, river hilsa are tastier than marine hilsa. The fish gain fat and protein and take on the taste of the river as they move upstream; the further they travel the tastier they become. As their taste peaks at the height of the rains, for many, hilsa is the taste of monsoon season. Their taste varies from river to river. Hilsa from the river Padma, are thought to be the tastiest due to the characteristics of the river water. However, the taste of hilsa is changing. Infrastructural interventions alter river ecologies, affecting the taste, smell and texture of fish, which is sensed by those who consume them.

        Hilsa can no longer be found in the Buriganga River, one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Its waters are a glossy blue-black, covered with rampant islands of water hyacinth which feed on contaminants. The river carries an all-pervasive stench from effluents spewed from tanneries, garment factories, cement plants and fertiliser manufacturers along its banks. The flushing effects of the monsoon carries pollutants downstream, affecting fish and people who depend on them. Environmental activists believe pollution is changing hilsa movements. Hilsa have a highly developed olfactory organ, making them sensitive to smell and taste. Pollutants may impact their olfactory memory and influence migration routes.

          Bede are skilled snake catchers in Bangladesh who remove poisonous snakes that infest Bengali villages during monsoon season. Bede lead nomadic lives, moving on boats across the riverine landscape of the Bengal delta. They charm snakes and cure snake bites as they travel. Monsoon season is important for the Bede as this is when snakes are most active and river water is high, allowing easy movement. While charming snakes, they perform rituals and songs to the Bengali snake goddess Manasa. In recent times, rivers have deteriorated and snake populations have declined making Bede nomadic life increasingly challenging.

          Snake and naga worship was part of pre-Buddhist animist traditions in Myanmar. A place with lingering associations to naga beliefs are the mud volcanoes of Minbu, known as Naga Pywet Taung, or ‘mountain where the naga breathes’. Worshippers pour milk libations into the bubbling mud pools and give offerings to goddess Naga Mae Daw. Minbu is located near the Myanmar oil fields of Yenangyaung. They provide tangible connections to the treasures of the earth that nagas are rumoured to guard. Although nagas dwell in the underworld, they are also believed to have power over wind and rain.

          Snake rituals and associated mythologies embody intimate connections between humans, snakes, weather and environment that have emerged over time. These practices are not just symbolic, but maintain ties between humans, nonhumans and their earthly ecologies. In recent years there has been a significant decline in snake populations throughout the Indian subcontinent and around the globe. South Asia is where most urban growth is expected to occur in coming decades, with further consequences for nonhuman species. Snakes are particularly at risk and although rituals offer ways of ‘making kin’ with snakes, they may not be sufficient to ensure their future survival.

        Year after year, as they sweep across the Indian terrain, the southwest and northeast monsoons act as architects of seasonal change. Like the monsoon itself, these changes are both material and social. A project of extremes, monsoonal heat and rain produce matter, labour, exploitation and resistance. Salt, one of monsoonal India’s oldest and most reliable resources, is one such material and social practice. Whether found in a geologic deposit or harvested as a seasonal fruit of the monsoonal sun, the need for salt, an indispensable ingredient of life, gave rise to colonial conquest and heralded the call to battle for independence.

      The seasonal passage of the southwest and northeast monsoons determines both the timeline and the bounty of India’s salt economy as it splits the arc of the sun’s annual march between the east and west coasts of the subcontinent. Tuned to the rhythms of the monsoons, the extraction of salt is aided by dry monsoon winds and their magnification by the pre- and post-monsoon sun. Today, India produces the third largest amount of salt in the world, an exponential growth since Independence in 1947.

      In the wake of victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the English East Indian Company (EEIC) gained control of the salt works near Kolkata. Two years later they imposed the first official Salt Tax on the works, doubling land rent and levying a transport tax on manufacturers and traders. After the Indian Rebellion a century later, the British Indian Government formalised the legal and physical infrastructures of salt management initiated by the EEIC with passing of the Salt Act of 1882.

      The government monopoly of India’s salt trade was institutionalised by the construction of official salt depots and monitored transportation routes that impeded the rise of rogue producers and distributors. To reduce occurrence of illegal salt production and smuggling between districts, the British constructed an Inland Customs Line, otherwise known as the Great Hedge of India, which extended 2,500 miles from the north of Punjab to the western boundary of Orissa, effectively segregating the salt production of the southwest monsoon from that of the northeast.

In 1930 Mahatma Gandhi led a small band of Indian nationals from his hometown Ahmedabad to the coastal village of Dandi.

                Dhaka lies at the centre of this terra-aqueous
                monsoonal terrain on the southern edge of a spur
                of high ground called the Madhupur Tract. This
                tract of clay floats above the Dupi Tila aquifer, a
                subterranean reservoir that provides high quality
                groundwater to the city. Dhaka is bounded by
                four rivers and criss-crossed by a meshwork of
                smaller water courses that are seasonally fed by
                the monsoon. After independence, it expanded
                northwards along the clay tract, but, more recently
                growth has been directed westwards, protected
                by an embankment along the Buriganga River, and
                eastwards, where it has displaced agricultural
                lands, lakes and canals and reshaped their
                hydrological ecologies

                Since the late 1980s, Dhaka East has
                been the target of speculative urban
                development driven by the powerful
                real estate sector. It is an area of low
                floodplains and marshy lands that are
                inundated during the monsoon. To prepare
                land for development, land is elevated
                above predicted flood levels through a
                process known as sand pumping. Dredgers
                suction vast quantities of sand from river
                beds, which is then pumped from barges
                via steel pipes into the floodplains and
                marshlands. Dhaka East is this being
                reimagined and reformed from the fluid
                fabric of the monsoon via the extraction
                and redistribution of sand.

              <p id="MoghulText" class="paragraph">
                Under Moghul rule, Dhaka rose from a humble
                military outpost to a burgeoning metropolis
                driven largely by the production of textiles.
                Royal workshops, with their hub in Dhaka, were
                established to supervise the manufacture of fine
                muslin cloth for the court of the Emperor. Over
                time Dhaka weavers became the most famous
                in India. Dacca muslin, known as <em>mulmul khas</em>
                or imperial cloth, gained a reputation for its
                extraordinary qualities, beauty and fineness.
                These properties were connected to the city’s
                monsoonal landscape, in which a particular
                variety of cotton, locally known as photee, was
                grown. Temperature and humidity, soil ecology
                and minerals within the river water imparted
                it with unique qualities. Weaving was timed in
                accordance with the humidity of the monsoon
                and the practice of placing shallow vessels of
                water beneath looms to keep the fabric moist
                gave rise to the notion that Dacca muslins were
                woven under water.

                Following independence in 1971,
                Bangladesh set in place neoliberal
                policies that saw an exponential
                growth in the garment industry. Like
                the Moghul textile industry had been,
                the hub of this industry is Dhaka, but
                unlike it, it supplies cheap clothes to the
                global market. The modern industry is
                predicated on the exploitation of cheap
                labour and what Jason Moore called
                “cheap nature”.<sup>1</sup>
                 Garment production
                is dependent on water for all steps
                of manufacturing, from washing and
                dyeing to textile finishing. Most of the
                water is sourced from the Dupi Tila
                aquifer, which is being depleted by
                millions of cubic metres of water each
                year. The industry also disposes large
                quantities of contaminated wastewater
                into Dhaka’s interlinked rivers and
                canals. This has meant that many of
                Dhaka’s rivers have been pronounced
                biologically dead, with implications for
                life and livelihoods downstream

                The timeline of the rise of the garment sector in
                Dhaka corresponds closely with the rise of the real
                estate sector. In the 1970s there were only five
                registered property developers in Dhaka; by 2004,
                there were 250 and there are now more than 1,500
                active companies. The close ties between the
                two sectors are embodied in powerful diversified
                business groups that consist of textile and spinning
                mills, dredging companies, cement and steel
                manufacturers and property development. These
                clusters use their power and political connections
                to pull strings and acquire land and capital. Such
                conglomerates dominate Bangladesh’s economy
                and drive Dhaka’s expansion.

                On October 14, 2011, I was taken to see a site for a
                prospective project for a preschool on the outskirts of
                Dhaka city. After an hour’s drive from the city, the site
                was pointed out to me. To my surprise, I could not see
                any land; rather what I saw was a flooded river bank.
                I exclaimed “I don’t see any land!” This, of course, is
                a typical reaction of an architect who would expect
                to see a piece of land for a prospective project, not
                water. I was then assured land would emerge within a
                couple of weeks.<sup>2</sup>

                Jol O Jongoler Kabbo, meaning ‘the rhythm of water
                and forest’ is a weekend retreat designed by landscape
                architect Khondaker Hasibul Kabir in Pubail, Bangladesh.
                Its architecture is constructed as part of a social
                waterscape and encourages multi-sensory engagement.
                The resort conserves wetlands and a patch of forest and
                employs the neighbouring community in management and
                maintenance. The retreat is a counterpoint to the traumatic
                transformation of the landscape taking place around it in
                the name of industrialisation and development.

        Three of ten major world-making rivers that rise on the Tibetan Plateau - the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra – frame the monsoon’s path, from the Indus River’s south-westward flow towards the Arabian Sea, to the eastward confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra as they make their way to the Bay of Bengal. Near the entry of each into the Bay, the Ganges and Brahmaputra have given rise to two of south Asia’s historic centres of culture – Kolkata and Dhaka. Each also harbours a colonial history that re-engineered the meteorological relationships of agricultural and economic landscapes, projecting both into the global financial sphere of climate speculation.

            As one of the first centres of colonial wealth and
            power on the Bay of Bengal, Kolkata’s riverine and
            coastal landscape offered British colonisers a unique
            opportunity to externalise local capital into emerging
            global markets. The reconstruction of Kolkata’s
            relationship to the Ganges and its tributaries via
            local and regionally scaled canal building and
            marsh reclamation projects laid the groundwork
            for a meteoro-agro-economics that recast
            monsoonal grounds as territorial indebtedness. As
            an indispensable precondition for the commodity
            economy’s conquest of South Asia’s monsoon
            driven economy, the construction of canals from
            Kolkata eastward laid the groundwork for national
            dependency on international lines of credit and
            environmental design schemes that extracted debt
            repayment by perpetuating precarity.

                monsoon away from riverine valleys and onto drier
                terrain, effectively retooling the nation’s economy.
                The project of canal building inverted the relationship
                between wealth and weather that had historically

                    The construction of the Ganges Canal from 1840

                    reduced Gangetic flows before they could reach
                    Kolkata in the lower delta. With a less reliable
                    relationship to the monsoonal flows of the Ganges,
                    nearby farmland grew less fertile and the farmers
                    more vulnerable to climate variation. As traditional
                    farmers struggled, the industry of credit lending
                    grew and contributed to the colonial reorientation

                        Canals have always been agents of neoliberal
                        ambition, bringing the environment into marketdriven systems of policy making that capitalise
                        on the variability of earth and climate systems.
                        Securitisation, or insurance, is one of the primary
                        techniques for turning debt into tradable commodity.
                        Working in tandem with the construction of canals
                        to secure the productivity of India’s soils, the risks
                        of a volatile climate were offset with an infusion of
                        credit capital, promising increased land and power in
                        turn for any failed debt repayment. To secure against
                        market failure, the government made provisions
                        for agricultural insurance, yet, structured around
                        famine, not drought, it failed to reduce the economic
                        significance of weather

                            through the Bay of Bengal, the English East India
                            Company turned to Dhaka, the historic city residing
                            at the confluence of monsoonal rivers to the east
                            of Kolkata. The ecology, urban form, and economic

                            ever-shifting courses of monsoonal discharge.
                            To minimise the impact of each shift, canals and
                            embankments were constructed to offset any

                                Across monsoonal South Asia, hydrological
                                management infrastructures were constructed to
                                circumvent the inherent variability of the weather
                                through the engineered extraction of meteorological
                                materials into concrete forms of management.
                                Canal networks created a monsoonal ecology of
                                meteoro-agro-economics as central to today’s
                                global marketplace of climate finance as it was to
                                yesterday’s structuring of monsoonal agriculture.
                                By exploiting the monsoon’s indeterminacies,
                                developers, consultants, and politicians reorganise
                                the future by concentrating power and capital flows
                                in the present. Each recurring disaster generates
                                a perceived scarcity of time that expedites the
                                conditions necessary for hurried credit swaps
                                and foreign direct investment that re-inscribe neocolonial power relations. Canal projects re-designed
                                hydro-meteorological relations and monetised the
                                monsoon, laying the groundwork for the current,
                                shared crisis of climate disaster and debt.
