                      <p class="rightSideText"> Monsoonal Multiplicities is an exhibition of work arising from a five-year engagement with the monsoon in India, Bangladesh, London and Myanmar by the European Research Council funded project, Monsoon Assemblages. It offers visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon by following stories of entangled beings, energies, infrastructures, life-worlds, matters, technologies and knowledge practices and their mobilisation by colonial and neo-colonial agendas. The stories are organised under five themes – <u>framings, infrastructures, interspecies interlocutors</u>, matters and urban assemblages, that serve as cuts through monsoonal encounters. The website has been designed to enable visitors to navigate rhizomatically through the stories and themes – to scroll down, leap across, return, zoom in, pause, or in other ways interact with their content without ever having to return to a home page. Navigation becomes a way of constructing circulations and cross-cutting relations, providing visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon in all its multiplicity.

                      In March 2021 Monsoon Assemblages will host a programme of online events, a walking tour and an artists’ residency in London to coincide with the launch of the exhibition. These events will open the work of Monsoon Assemblages to critical debate and invite audiences to think through its implications for spatial, ethnographic and artistic research practice at a time of ecocide, unstable weather patterns, viral toxicity and violent socio-political hegemony

                          In this one-hour Virtual Tour, Leila Redpath will give participants a flavour of how the East India Company grew from a modest fleet of spice traders in 1600 to become the most powerful multinational corporation the world has ever known. But what ever happened to it? Why is it so hidden? And what is its legacy on the ground today? The tour will convey both the ingenuity and ruthlessness of the EIC and the ways it shaped our world today.

                      Known as ilish in Bengali, hilsa are a monsoonal
                      species. They inhabit the entire coastline of the Indian
                      Ocean, but they are most abundant in the upper
                      reaches of the Bay of Bengal. At the apex of the Bay
                      immense monsoonal flows merge with ocean currents
                      and tides creating a unique ecosystem. While hilsa
                      spend most of their life in the Bay they migrate to the
                      rivers of the delta to breed. The rains of the south‐west
                      monsoon act as an ecological trigger, initiating their
                      spawning migration. Hilsa used to migrate to the upper
                      reaches of all the major rivers, but in recent times their
                      range has dramatically reduced. The altered mobilities
                      of the hilsa are an indicator of shifting human-nonhuman relations

                Fishers from the Meghna River ascribe changing hilsa
                migration patterns to the inhospitable river environment.
                The Farakka Barrage, commissioned in 1975 by the
                Indian government, transformed Bangladesh’s rivers.
                The barrage reduced the velocity of monsoonal flows
                leading to siltation and sedimentation downstream,
                restricting hilsa movements. Fishers are also concerned
                by illegal sand mining, fuelled by Dhaka’s booming
                construction industry. Flotillas of sand dredgers vacuum
                gravel and sand from the river, altering its bathymetry
                and disturbing fish migration routes. In response to
                changing hilsa movements, fishers are forced deeper
                into the turbulent Bay of Bengal.

          In recent decades, rapid urbanization and the increased purchasing power of the urban middle class has led to greater fish consumption. Increased demand for the “queen of fish” resulted in unsustainable fishing practices with hilsa numbers declining from the 1970s onwards, reaching record lows in the early 2000s. Alarmed by diminishing numbers and changes to migration patterns, scientists mobilised to conserve the species. To curb unsustainable fishing, and regulate supply to urban markets, scientists developed annual ban periods to “save mother hilsa”.

        Hilsa is cooked in a myriad of ways, but knowing how to buy hilsa is an essential part of the cooking process. Not all hilsa are the same, river hilsa are tastier than marine hilsa. The fish gain fat and protein and take on the taste of the river as they move upstream; the further they travel the tastier they become. As their taste peaks at the height of the rains, for many, hilsa is the taste of monsoon season. Their taste varies from river to river. Hilsa from the river Padma, are thought to be the tastiest due to the characteristics of the river water. However, the taste of hilsa is changing. Infrastructural interventions alter river ecologies, affecting the taste, smell and texture of fish, which is sensed by those who consume them.

        Hilsa can no longer be found in the Buriganga River, one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Its waters are a glossy blue-black, covered with rampant islands of water hyacinth which feed on contaminants. The river carries an all-pervasive stench from effluents spewed from tanneries, garment factories, cement plants and fertiliser manufacturers along its banks. The flushing effects of the monsoon carries pollutants downstream, affecting fish and people who depend on them. Environmental activists believe pollution is changing hilsa movements. Hilsa have a highly developed olfactory organ, making them sensitive to smell and taste. Pollutants may impact their olfactory memory and influence migration routes.

Worshippers pour milk libations into the bubbling mud pools and give offerings to goddess Naga Mae Daw. Minbu is located near the Myanmar oil fields of Yenangyaung. They provide tangible connections to the treasures of the earth that nagas are rumoured to guard. Although nagas dwell in the underworld, they are also believed to have power over wind and rain.

        Year after year, as they sweep across the Indian terrain, the southwest and northeast monsoons act as architects of seasonal change. Like the monsoon itself, these changes are both material and social. A project of extremes, monsoonal heat and rain produce matter, labour, exploitation and resistance. Salt, one of monsoonal India’s oldest and most reliable resources, is one such material and social practice. Whether found in a geologic deposit or harvested as a seasonal fruit of the monsoonal sun, the need for salt, an indispensable ingredient of life, gave rise to colonial conquest and heralded the call to battle for independence.

Tuned to the rhythms of the monsoons, the extraction of salt is aided by dry monsoon winds and their magnification by the pre- and post-monsoon sun. Today, India produces the third largest amount of salt in the world, an exponential growth since Independence in 1947.

Two years later they imposed the first official Salt Tax on the works, doubling land rent and levying a transport tax on manufacturers and traders. After the Indian Rebellion a century later, the British Indian Government formalised the legal and physical infrastructures of salt management initiated by the EEIC with passing of the Salt Act of 1882.

      The government monopoly of India’s salt trade was institutionalised by the construction of official salt depots and monitored transportation routes that impeded the rise of rogue producers and distributors. To reduce occurrence of illegal salt production and smuggling between districts, the British constructed an Inland Customs Line, otherwise known as the Great Hedge of India, which extended 2,500 miles from the north of Punjab to the western boundary of Orissa, effectively segregating the salt production of the southwest monsoon from that of the northeast.

      Barring a brief period from 1694 to 1825, the British public viewed salt taxation as a violation of human rights and unfairly levied against low- income populations. Yet, according to the Salt Tax, it was illegal for anyone who was not an authorised British national to collect and produce salt in India. In 1930 Mahatma Gandhi led a small band of Indian nationals from his hometown Ahmedabad to the coastal village of Dandi. Upon reaching the sea, he reached down and scooped a handful of salt from the sand. This was a direct violation of British Law in India and an act that stoked the fires of Independence.

      Barring a brief period from 1694 to 1825, the British public viewed salt taxation as a violation of human rights and unfairly levied against low- income populations.

  “What if we approach social movement action not as targeting existing political power but as experimenting with worlds? What if we see social movement action not as addressing existing institutions for redistributing justice but as the creation of alternative forms of existence that reclaim material justice from below? And, what if this becomes possible not when social movements engage in resistance to power but when they experiment with the materiality of life?”<sup>2</sup>

              Bangladesh is a fluctuating monsoonal terrain.

In addition to this, it is impacted by oceanic dynamics that originate in the Bay of Bengal such as tides, reversing currents, cyclones and storm surges that frequently push seawater many kilometres inland and shape coastal ecologies

                Dhaka lies at the centre of this terra-aqueous
                monsoonal terrain on the southern edge of a spur
                of high ground called the Madhupur Tract. This
                tract of clay floats above the Dupi Tila aquifer, a
                subterranean reservoir that provides high quality
                groundwater to the city. Dhaka is bounded by
                four rivers and criss-crossed by a meshwork of
                smaller water courses that are seasonally fed by
                the monsoon. After independence, it expanded
                northwards along the clay tract, but, more recently
                growth has been directed westwards, protected
                by an embankment along the Buriganga River, and
                eastwards, where it has displaced agricultural
                lands, lakes and canals and reshaped their
                hydrological ecologies

                Since the late 1980s, Dhaka East has
                been the target of speculative urban
                development driven by the powerful
                real estate sector. It is an area of low
                floodplains and marshy lands that are
                inundated during the monsoon. To prepare
                land for development, land is elevated
                above predicted flood levels through a
                process known as sand pumping. Dredgers
                suction vast quantities of sand from river
                beds, which is then pumped from barges
                via steel pipes into the floodplains and
                marshlands. Dhaka East is this being
                reimagined and reformed from the fluid
                fabric of the monsoon via the extraction
                and redistribution of sand.

                Under Moghul rule, Dhaka rose from a humble
                military outpost to a burgeoning metropolis
                driven largely by the production of textiles.
                Royal workshops, with their hub in Dhaka, were
                established to supervise the manufacture of fine
                muslin cloth for the court of the Emperor. Over
                time Dhaka weavers became the most famous
                in India. Dacca muslin, known as <em>mulmul khas</em>
                or imperial cloth, gained a reputation for its
                extraordinary qualities, beauty and fineness.
                These properties were connected to the city’s
                monsoonal landscape, in which a particular
                variety of cotton, locally known as photee, was
                grown. Temperature and humidity, soil ecology
                and minerals within the river water imparted
                it with unique qualities. Weaving was timed in
                accordance with the humidity of the monsoon
                and the practice of placing shallow vessels of
                water beneath looms to keep the fabric moist

              <p id="NeoText" class="paragraph">
                Following independence in 1971,
                Bangladesh set in place neoliberal
                policies that saw an exponential
                growth in the garment industry. Like
                the Moghul textile industry had been,
                the hub of this industry is Dhaka, but
                unlike it, it supplies cheap clothes to the
                global market. The modern industry is
                predicated on the exploitation of cheap
                labour and what Jason Moore called
                “cheap nature”.<sup>1</sup>
                 Garment production
                is dependent on water for all steps
                of manufacturing, from washing and
                dyeing to textile finishing. Most of the
                water is sourced from the Dupi Tila
                aquifer, which is being depleted by
                millions of cubic metres of water each
                year. The industry also disposes large
                quantities of contaminated wastewater
                into Dhaka’s interlinked rivers and
                canals. This has meant that many of
                Dhaka’s rivers have been pronounced
                biologically dead, with implications for
                life and livelihoods downstream

                The timeline of the rise of the garment sector in
                Dhaka corresponds closely with the rise of the real
                estate sector. In the 1970s there were only five
                registered property developers in Dhaka; by 2004,
                there were 250 and there are now more than 1,500
                active companies. The close ties between the
                two sectors are embodied in powerful diversified
                business groups that consist of textile and spinning
                mills, dredging companies, cement and steel
                manufacturers and property development. These
                clusters use their power and political connections
                to pull strings and acquire land and capital. Such
                conglomerates dominate Bangladesh’s economy
                and drive Dhaka’s expansion.

                On October 14, 2011, I was taken to see a site for a
                prospective project for a preschool on the outskirts of
                Dhaka city. After an hour’s drive from the city, the site
                was pointed out to me. To my surprise, I could not see
                any land; rather what I saw was a flooded river bank.
                I exclaimed “I don’t see any land!” This, of course, is
                a typical reaction of an architect who would expect
                to see a piece of land for a prospective project, not
                water. I was then assured land would emerge within a
                couple of weeks.<sup>2</sup>

                Jol O Jongoler Kabbo, meaning ‘the rhythm of water
                and forest’ is a weekend retreat designed by landscape
                architect Khondaker Hasibul Kabir in Pubail, Bangladesh.
                Its architecture is constructed as part of a social
                waterscape and encourages multi-sensory engagement.
                The resort conserves wetlands and a patch of forest and
                employs the neighbouring community in management and
                maintenance. The retreat is a counterpoint to the traumatic
                transformation of the landscape taking place around it in
                the name of industrialisation and development.

        Three of ten major world-making rivers that rise on the Tibetan Plateau - the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra – frame the monsoon’s path, from the Indus River’s south-westward flow towards the Arabian Sea, to the eastward confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra as they make their way to the Bay of Bengal. Near the entry of each into the Bay, the Ganges and Brahmaputra have given rise to two of south Asia’s historic centres of culture – Kolkata and Dhaka. Each also harbours a colonial history that re-engineered the meteorological relationships of agricultural and economic landscapes, projecting both into the global financial sphere of climate speculation.

            As one of the first centres of colonial wealth and
            power on the Bay of Bengal, Kolkata’s riverine and
            coastal landscape offered British colonisers a unique
            opportunity to externalise local capital into emerging
            global markets. The reconstruction of Kolkata’s
            relationship to the Ganges and its tributaries via
            local and regionally scaled canal building and
            marsh reclamation projects laid the groundwork
            for a meteoro-agro-economics that recast
            monsoonal grounds as territorial indebtedness. As
            an indispensable precondition for the commodity
            economy’s conquest of South Asia’s monsoon
            driven economy, the construction of canals from
            Kolkata eastward laid the groundwork for national
            dependency on international lines of credit and
            environmental design schemes that extracted debt
            repayment by perpetuating precarity.

                The construction of the Ganges Canal from 1840
                onwards grew the area of India’s irrigated land and
                reduced Gangetic flows before they could reach
                Kolkata in the lower delta. With a less reliable
                relationship to the monsoonal flows of the Ganges,
                nearby farmland grew less fertile and the farmers
                more vulnerable to climate variation. As traditional
                farmers struggled, the industry of credit lending
                grew and contributed to the colonial reorientation
                of Kolkata towards the Bay of Bengal and overseas
                trade. Farmers requested lines of credit for seedsowing and crop harvesting, crafting the rise and
                fall of India’s money market around the arrival and
                departure of the monsoon.

                    Canals have always been agents of neoliberal

                    on the variability of earth and climate systems.
                    Securitisation, or insurance, is one of the primary
                    techniques for turning debt into tradable commodity.
                    Working in tandem with the construction of canals
                    to secure the productivity of India’s soils, the risks
                    of a volatile climate were offset with an infusion of
                    credit capital, promising increased land and power in
                    turn for any failed debt repayment. To secure against
                    market failure, the government made provisions
                    for agricultural insurance, yet, structured around
                    famine, not drought, it failed to reduce the economic

                  <p class="copyText">
                    Across monsoonal South Asia, hydrological
                    management infrastructures were constructed to
                    circumvent the inherent variability of the weather
                    through the engineered extraction of meteorological
                    materials into concrete forms of management.
                    Canal networks created a monsoonal ecology of
                    meteoro-agro-economics as central to today’s
                    global marketplace of climate finance as it was to
                    yesterday’s structuring of monsoonal agriculture.
                    By exploiting the monsoon’s indeterminacies,
                    developers, consultants, and politicians reorganise
                    the future by concentrating power and capital flows
                    in the present. Each recurring disaster generates
                    a perceived scarcity of time that expedites the
                    conditions necessary for hurried credit swaps
                    and foreign direct investment that re-inscribe neocolonial power relations. Canal projects re-designed
                    hydro-meteorological relations and monetised the
                    monsoon, laying the groundwork for the current,
                    shared crisis of climate disaster and debt.

        The monsoon’s distinctive temporality distinguishes it from other weather events. Dominant depictions of the monsoon highlight its temporal patterns, often representing ‘normal’ onset and withdrawal dates. Nevertheless, the localised behaviour of this powerful weather pattern often does not conform to such macroscale representations. Monsoon rhythms and tempos vary as weather interacts with landscapes, places, people and things.

        Monsoon rhythms create temporal structures
        for human and non-human life at macro, meso
        and micro scales. Learning to understand these
        multiscalar rhythms, tempos and durations and
        their entanglement with social life is essential if
        we are to take the agencies of such processes
        seriously. During fieldwork, using an assortment
        of methods including walking, seasonal calendars,
        visual methods and sensory witnessing, we learned
        to perceive a multiplicity of monsoonal temporalities
        and temporal slippages from deep time to seasonal
        time to everyday time.

        The landscapes that Chennai, Dhaka and Yangon
        are situated within have been shaped by monsoonal
        forces over the <em>longue duree</em>. Walking these
        landscapes helped us to understand the temporal
        rhythms and material processes that formed them.
        Climbing Mount Popa, a dormant volcano in central
        Myanmar, we observed and felt patterns of erosion
        etched out by successive monsoon seasons under
        our feet. Sediments created through weathering offer
        insights into the earth systems, cycles and rhythms
        that produce monsoon time. By recording these
        rhythms, sedimentary ‘earth archives’ illuminate the
        array of nonhuman forces that shape the monsoon
        and its changing temporal patterns

        Changing atmospheric conditions define the
        seasons that divide the year for societies across
        the globe. South Asian calendars typically divide the
        year into the hot season, the cold season and the
        rainy season, the rains being the pivot of the year.
        During fieldwork in Bangladesh we drew monsoonal
        calendars with farmers, fishers, river nomads, and
        meteorologists. The calendars charted the planting,
        transplanting and harvesting of rice; the lifecycle and
        migrations of hilsa fish; the seasonal flux of rivers
        and breeding cycles of snakes; the meteorological
        seasons and patterns of storms and cyclones.
        Making each calendar revealed a multiplicity of
        human and nonhuman monsoonal attunements.

       <em>Kolam</em> is a daily ritual practiced by Tamil Hindu
        women each morning in the thresholds of houses,
        temples and businesses. It involves drawing on
        washed thresholds with rice flour or chalk. Patterns
        are drawn with the tips of the fingers using pinches
        of flour held between the thumb and the first finger
        and letting the powder fall in a continuous line.
        Drawing is directed by a grid of pullis or dots that are
        encircled, looped or joined using straight or curved
        lines. Kolams are transient. They are created in a
        few minutes, but after a few hours, they disappear
        as insects or birds feed on the rice flour or wind or
        people’s footsteps erase them. Processes of making

        Across the Indian subcontinent monsoonal
        temporalities are changing. These meteorological
        shifts are often subtle and hard to enumerate, but
        they have significant implications for human and
        nonhuman life and the liveability of monsoonal
        cities. Short bursts of intense rain lead to flooding
        because impervious urban environments cannot
        absorb heavy rainfall over compressed timescales.
        Delayed onset and breaks in the monsoon of a week
        or more results in severe water shortages. Rising
        temperatures cause the duration of heatwaves to
        increase, amplifying urban heat island effects. Such

        The monsoon and its cycles are coextensive with
        sediment, formed when seasonal monsoon rains
        rot rock surfaces, dislodge their matter, swirl it
        across landscapes, deposit it on floodplains and
        carry it to the ocean. Here it is pushed around by
        tides and currents and slowly sinks, until, disturbed
        by tectonic forces, it remerges as the folded strata
        of new sedimentary rock. These processes are the
        mechanisms through which the earth recycles itself.
        They transform the monsoon from a weather system
        into a geomorphic agent and undermine the idea
        of terrain as a stable, inert backdrop to the human

        forces and exposed to the atmosphere, their mineral
        structures become unstable, disintegrate and
        reassemble into other forms more suited to their
        cooler, wetter surroundings. This process, known as
        weathering, materialises not only how earth matter
        weathers its climate, but, also how buildings, bodies
        and all forms of terrestrial life weather the total
        climate of the weather world. <br> <br>

        Like these trees, we are all, each of us, weathering.<sup>4</sup>

        Once freed from their middle-earth molecular
        strictures, particles of sediment join the weather, so
        to speak. Transported away from their originating
        rock by wind or water, they become dynamic, transcorporeal water bodies, barely distinguishable from
        the dynamics of the flows that carry them. They move
        by what is known as saltation – frolicking, tumbling
        and bouncing along. This mode of mobility transforms
        the particles themselves, the surfaces they move
        over and the flows that move them into turbulent
        assemblages of terra-aqueous matter.

        Territorial disruption
      </h1>

      <p class="copyTextLeft">
        All human habitation of the earth, even when it doesn’t
        entail circumnavigation or other excursions, is a
        kind of journey – a passage through the multi-scalar
        rhythms, singularities and thresholds of a planetary
        surface in motion.<sup>5</sup>
        The forcefulness of this vitality carries with it the
        potential for violent territorial disruption. Dwelling
        alongside mobile terra-aqueous flows requires tuning
        to and working with their fluid becomings, while
        acknowledging their fearsome capacity to undo
        sustaining human connections and footings.

      <p class="copyTextLeft">
        The fishing village of Chaung Gyi in Myanmar is
        located where the Ayeyarwady River river slows down
        and splits into its delta. At this point, banks and
        shoals constantly shift as the river adjusts its flows.
        Raymonde Bieler, while a student in the Monsoon
        Assemblages studio in 2018, designed a process
        to negotiate with the river to retain sediment as
        ground for a new civic institution for land claims and
        negotiations. The Land Registry, as she called it, was
        sited on the first sedimentary island assembled by her
        ground forming strategy, as a prototype for building in
        terra-aqueous terrain.

        The surface of the land … is made by nature to decay
        … Our fertile plains are formed from the ruins of the
        mountains. <sup>6</sup> <br> <br>
        As monsoonal rivers descend to coastal plains, they
        slow down and spread out. They wash over low-lying
        terrain and, as they recede, they leave fertile traces of
        their passing material presence behind. At this point,
        sediment becomes soil and the sciences and politics
        of measure are born. It was the geometricians of
        Egypt, who, in retracing the borders of fields each year
        as the flood waters of the Nile River receded, gave
        rise, in the West, to ideas of politics, property and the
        law. Contrary to conceptions that these ideas were
        conjured up on solid ground, they emerged dripping
        from the alluvial deposits of the Nile, driven by the
        seasonal dynamics of the East African monsoon.

          As sediment settles and sinks, it is subject to
          subterranean pressures and temperatures. Overlying
          layers compact lower layers, slowly squeezing out
          their water content and decreasing their porosity.
          Chemical and structural changes to sediment
          particles, the fluids between them and any organic
          matter buried with them occur. These lively physical
          and geochemical process produce the earth’s stores
          of breccia, sandstone, mudstone and limestone, its
          iron and aluminium ore, its aquifers and its fossil
          fuels. As sites of political issue formation, human
          interactions with these stratified conglomerations
          have long played constitutive roles in social and
          political life.
