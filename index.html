                      <p class="rightSideTextMM"> Monsoonal Multiplicities is an exhibition of work arising from a five-year engagement with the monsoon in India, Bangladesh, London and Myanmar by the European Research Council funded project, Monsoon Assemblages. It offers visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon by following stories of entangled beings, energies, infrastructures, life-worlds, matters, technologies and knowledge practices and their mobilisation by colonial and neo-colonial agendas. The stories are organised under five themes – <u>framings, infrastructures, interspecies interlocutors, matters and urban assemblages</u>, that serve as cuts through monsoonal encounters. The website has been designed to enable visitors to navigate rhizomatically through the stories and themes – to scroll down, leap across, return, zoom in, pause, or in other ways interact with their content without ever having to return to a home page. Navigation becomes a way of constructing circulations and cross-cutting relations, providing visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon in all its multiplicity.

                      In March 2021 Monsoon Assemblages will host a programme of online events, a walking tour and an artists’ residency in London to coincide with the launch of the exhibition. These events will open the work of Monsoon Assemblages to critical debate and invite audiences to think through its implications for spatial, ethnographic and artistic research practice at a time of ecocide, unstable weather patterns, viral toxicity and violent socio-political hegemony

                          In this one-hour Virtual Tour, Leila Redpath will give participants a flavour of how the East India Company grew from a modest fleet of spice traders in 1600 to become the most powerful multinational corporation the world has ever known. But what ever happened to it? Why is it so hidden? And what is its legacy on the ground today? The tour will convey both the ingenuity and ruthlessness of the EIC and the ways it shaped our world today.

                      Known as ilish in Bengali, hilsa are a monsoonal
                      species. They inhabit the entire coastline of the Indian
                      Ocean, but they are most abundant in the upper
                      reaches of the Bay of Bengal. At the apex of the Bay
                      immense monsoonal flows merge with ocean currents
                      and tides creating a unique ecosystem. While hilsa
                      spend most of their life in the Bay they migrate to the
                      rivers of the delta to breed. The rains of the south‐west
                      monsoon act as an ecological trigger, initiating their
                      spawning migration. Hilsa used to migrate to the upper
                      reaches of all the major rivers, but in recent times their
                      range has dramatically reduced. The altered mobilities
                      of the hilsa are an indicator of shifting human-nonhuman relations

                Fishers from the Meghna River ascribe changing hilsa
                migration patterns to the inhospitable river environment.
                The Farakka Barrage, commissioned in 1975 by the
                Indian government, transformed Bangladesh’s rivers.
                The barrage reduced the velocity of monsoonal flows
                leading to siltation and sedimentation downstream,
                restricting hilsa movements. Fishers are also concerned
                by illegal sand mining, fuelled by Dhaka’s booming
                construction industry. Flotillas of sand dredgers vacuum
                gravel and sand from the river, altering its bathymetry
                and disturbing fish migration routes. In response to
                changing hilsa movements, fishers are forced deeper
                into the turbulent Bay of Bengal.

          In recent decades, rapid urbanization and the increased purchasing power of the urban middle class has led to greater fish consumption. Increased demand for the “queen of fish” resulted in unsustainable fishing practices with hilsa numbers declining from the 1970s onwards, reaching record lows in the early 2000s. Alarmed by diminishing numbers and changes to migration patterns, scientists mobilised to conserve the species. To curb unsustainable fishing, and regulate supply to urban markets, scientists developed annual ban periods to “save mother hilsa”.

        Hilsa is cooked in a myriad of ways, but knowing how to buy hilsa is an essential part of the cooking process. Not all hilsa are the same, river hilsa are tastier than marine hilsa. The fish gain fat and protein and take on the taste of the river as they move upstream; the further they travel the tastier they become. As their taste peaks at the height of the rains, for many, hilsa is the taste of monsoon season. Their taste varies from river to river. Hilsa from the river Padma, are thought to be the tastiest due to the characteristics of the river water. However, the taste of hilsa is changing. Infrastructural interventions alter river ecologies, affecting the taste, smell and texture of fish, which is sensed by those who consume them.

        Hilsa can no longer be found in the Buriganga River, one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Its waters are a glossy blue-black, covered with rampant islands of water hyacinth which feed on contaminants. The river carries an all-pervasive stench from effluents spewed from tanneries, garment factories, cement plants and fertiliser manufacturers along its banks. The flushing effects of the monsoon carries pollutants downstream, affecting fish and people who depend on them. Environmental activists believe pollution is changing hilsa movements. Hilsa have a highly developed olfactory organ, making them sensitive to smell and taste. Pollutants may impact their olfactory memory and influence migration routes.

Worshippers pour milk libations into the bubbling mud pools and give offerings to goddess Naga Mae Daw. Minbu is located near the Myanmar oil fields of Yenangyaung. They provide tangible connections to the treasures of the earth that nagas are rumoured to guard. Although nagas dwell in the underworld, they are also believed to have power over wind and rain.

South Asia is where most urban growth is expected to occur in coming decades, with further consequences for nonhuman species.

        Year after year, as they sweep across the Indian terrain, the southwest and northeast monsoons act as architects of seasonal change. Like the monsoon itself, these changes are both material and social. A project of extremes, monsoonal heat and rain produce matter, labour, exploitation and resistance. Salt, one of monsoonal India’s oldest and most reliable resources, is one such material and social practice. Whether found in a geologic deposit or harvested as a seasonal fruit of the monsoonal sun, the need for salt, an indispensable ingredient of life, gave rise to colonial conquest and heralded the call to battle for independence.

Tuned to the rhythms of the monsoons, the extraction of salt is aided by dry monsoon winds and their magnification by the pre- and post-monsoon sun. Today, India produces the third largest amount of salt in the world, an exponential growth since Independence in 1947.

      In the wake of victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the English East Indian Company (EEIC) gained control of the salt works near Kolkata. Two years later they imposed the first official Salt Tax on the works, doubling land rent and levying a transport tax on manufacturers and traders. After the Indian Rebellion a century later, the British Indian Government formalised the legal and physical infrastructures of salt management initiated by the EEIC with passing of the Salt Act of 1882.

      The government monopoly of India’s salt trade was institutionalised by the construction of official salt depots and monitored transportation routes that impeded the rise of rogue producers and distributors. To reduce occurrence of illegal salt production and smuggling between districts, the British constructed an Inland Customs Line, otherwise known as the Great Hedge of India, which extended 2,500 miles from the north of Punjab to the western boundary of Orissa, effectively segregating the salt production of the southwest monsoon from that of the northeast.

              Bangladesh is a fluctuating monsoonal terrain. It is almost half covered in water between June and October each year when it receives huge inflows of water and sediment carried from the Himalayas by the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers. In addition to this, it is impacted by oceanic dynamics that originate in the Bay of Bengal such as tides, reversing currents, cyclones and storm surges that frequently push seawater many kilometres inland and shape coastal ecologies

                Bangladesh’s sediment heavy rivers frequently braid
                or shift, creating precarious, nomadic units of land
                called chars that cannot be mapped, legally owned
                or recorded in revenue papers because they move
                around too quickly and too frequently. Chars have
                historically been occupied by precarious, marginal
                people, often without official documents. Those who
                live on them lead perilous, calamitous lives. When the
                monsoon breaks and the flow of rivers increase each
                year, their land frequently deserts them, their shelters
                are devastated, crops are damaged and livestock
                washed away. As the river recedes, new chars emerge
                and fierce, at times violent struggles to occupy them,
                overseen by local strongmen, ensue.

                Dhaka lies at the centre of this terra-aqueous
                monsoonal terrain on the southern edge of a spur
                of high ground called the Madhupur Tract. This
                tract of clay floats above the Dupi Tila aquifer, a
                subterranean reservoir that provides high quality
                groundwater to the city. Dhaka is bounded by
                four rivers and criss-crossed by a meshwork of
                smaller water courses that are seasonally fed by
                the monsoon. After independence, it expanded
                northwards along the clay tract, but, more recently
                growth has been directed westwards, protected
                by an embankment along the Buriganga River, and
                eastwards, where it has displaced agricultural
                lands, lakes and canals and reshaped their
                hydrological ecologies

                Since the late 1980s, Dhaka East has
                been the target of speculative urban
                development driven by the powerful
                real estate sector. It is an area of low
                floodplains and marshy lands that are
                inundated during the monsoon. To prepare
                land for development, land is elevated
                above predicted flood levels through a
                process known as sand pumping. Dredgers
                suction vast quantities of sand from river
                beds, which is then pumped from barges
                via steel pipes into the floodplains and
                marshlands. Dhaka East is this being
                reimagined and reformed from the fluid
                fabric of the monsoon via the extraction
                and redistribution of sand.

                Royal workshops, with their hub in Dhaka, were
                established to supervise the manufacture of fine
                muslin cloth for the court of the Emperor. Over
                time Dhaka weavers became the most famous

                or imperial cloth, gained a reputation for its
                extraordinary qualities, beauty and fineness.
                These properties were connected to the city’s
                monsoonal landscape, in which a particular
                variety of cotton, locally known as photee, was
                grown. Temperature and humidity, soil ecology
                and minerals within the river water imparted
                it with unique qualities. Weaving was timed in
                accordance with the humidity of the monsoon
                and the practice of placing shallow vessels of
                water beneath looms to keep the fabric moist
                gave rise to the notion that Dacca muslins were
                woven under water.

              <p id="NeoText" class="paragraph">
                Following independence in 1971,
                Bangladesh set in place neoliberal
                policies that saw an exponential
                growth in the garment industry. Like
                the Moghul textile industry had been,
                the hub of this industry is Dhaka, but
                unlike it, it supplies cheap clothes to the
                global market. The modern industry is
                predicated on the exploitation of cheap
                labour and what Jason Moore called
                “cheap nature”.<sup>1</sup>
                 Garment production
                is dependent on water for all steps
                of manufacturing, from washing and
                dyeing to textile finishing. Most of the
                water is sourced from the Dupi Tila
                aquifer, which is being depleted by
                millions of cubic metres of water each
                year. The industry also disposes large
                quantities of contaminated wastewater
                into Dhaka’s interlinked rivers and
                canals. This has meant that many of
                Dhaka’s rivers have been pronounced
                biologically dead, with implications for
                life and livelihoods downstream

                The timeline of the rise of the garment sector in
                Dhaka corresponds closely with the rise of the real
                estate sector. In the 1970s there were only five
                registered property developers in Dhaka; by 2004,
                there were 250 and there are now more than 1,500
                active companies. The close ties between the
                two sectors are embodied in powerful diversified
                business groups that consist of textile and spinning
                mills, dredging companies, cement and steel
                manufacturers and property development. These
                clusters use their power and political connections
                to pull strings and acquire land and capital. Such
                conglomerates dominate Bangladesh’s economy
                and drive Dhaka’s expansion.

                On October 14, 2011, I was taken to see a site for a
                prospective project for a preschool on the outskirts of
                Dhaka city. After an hour’s drive from the city, the site
                was pointed out to me. To my surprise, I could not see
                any land; rather what I saw was a flooded river bank.
                I exclaimed “I don’t see any land!” This, of course, is
                a typical reaction of an architect who would expect
                to see a piece of land for a prospective project, not
                water. I was then assured land would emerge within a
                couple of weeks.<sup>2</sup>

                Jol O Jongoler Kabbo, meaning ‘the rhythm of water
                and forest’ is a weekend retreat designed by landscape
                architect Khondaker Hasibul Kabir in Pubail, Bangladesh.
                Its architecture is constructed as part of a social
                waterscape and encourages multi-sensory engagement.
                The resort conserves wetlands and a patch of forest and
                employs the neighbouring community in management and
                maintenance. The retreat is a counterpoint to the traumatic
                transformation of the landscape taking place around it in
                the name of industrialisation and development.

        Three of ten major world-making rivers that rise on the Tibetan Plateau - the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra – frame the monsoon’s path, from the Indus River’s south-westward flow towards the Arabian Sea, to the eastward confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra as they make their way to the Bay of Bengal. Near the entry of each into the Bay, the Ganges and Brahmaputra have given rise to two of south Asia’s historic centres of culture – Kolkata and Dhaka. Each also harbours a colonial history that re-engineered the meteorological relationships of agricultural and economic landscapes, projecting both into the global financial sphere of climate speculation.

            As one of the first centres of colonial wealth and
            power on the Bay of Bengal, Kolkata’s riverine and
            coastal landscape offered British colonisers a unique
            opportunity to externalise local capital into emerging
            global markets. The reconstruction of Kolkata’s
            relationship to the Ganges and its tributaries via
            local and regionally scaled canal building and
            marsh reclamation projects laid the groundwork
            for a meteoro-agro-economics that recast
            monsoonal grounds as territorial indebtedness. As
            an indispensable precondition for the commodity
            economy’s conquest of South Asia’s monsoon
            driven economy, the construction of canals from
            Kolkata eastward laid the groundwork for national
            dependency on international lines of credit and
            environmental design schemes that extracted debt
            repayment by perpetuating precarity.

                The construction of the Ganges Canal from 1840
                onwards grew the area of India’s irrigated land and
                reduced Gangetic flows before they could reach
                Kolkata in the lower delta. With a less reliable
                relationship to the monsoonal flows of the Ganges,
                nearby farmland grew less fertile and the farmers
                more vulnerable to climate variation. As traditional
                farmers struggled, the industry of credit lending
                grew and contributed to the colonial reorientation
                of Kolkata towards the Bay of Bengal and overseas
                trade. Farmers requested lines of credit for seedsowing and crop harvesting, crafting the rise and
                fall of India’s money market around the arrival and
                departure of the monsoon.

                    Canals have always been agents of neoliberal

                    on the variability of earth and climate systems.
                    Securitisation, or insurance, is one of the primary
                    techniques for turning debt into tradable commodity.
                    Working in tandem with the construction of canals
                    to secure the productivity of India’s soils, the risks
                    of a volatile climate were offset with an infusion of
                    credit capital, promising increased land and power in
                    turn for any failed debt repayment. To secure against
                    market failure, the government made provisions
                    for agricultural insurance, yet, structured around
                    famine, not drought, it failed to reduce the economic

                  <p class="copyText">
                    Across monsoonal South Asia, hydrological
                    management infrastructures were constructed to
                    circumvent the inherent variability of the weather
                    through the engineered extraction of meteorological
                    materials into concrete forms of management.
                    Canal networks created a monsoonal ecology of
                    meteoro-agro-economics as central to today’s
                    global marketplace of climate finance as it was to
                    yesterday’s structuring of monsoonal agriculture.
                    By exploiting the monsoon’s indeterminacies,
                    developers, consultants, and politicians reorganise
                    the future by concentrating power and capital flows
                    in the present. Each recurring disaster generates
                    a perceived scarcity of time that expedites the
                    conditions necessary for hurried credit swaps
                    and foreign direct investment that re-inscribe neocolonial power relations. Canal projects re-designed
                    hydro-meteorological relations and monetised the
                    monsoon, laying the groundwork for the current,
                    shared crisis of climate disaster and debt.

        The monsoon’s distinctive temporality distinguishes it from other weather events. Dominant depictions of the monsoon highlight its temporal patterns, often representing ‘normal’ onset and withdrawal dates. Nevertheless, the localised behaviour of this powerful weather pattern often does not conform to such macroscale representations. Monsoon rhythms and tempos vary as weather interacts with landscapes, places, people and things.

        Monsoon rhythms create temporal structures
        for human and non-human life at macro, meso
        and micro scales. Learning to understand these
        multiscalar rhythms, tempos and durations and
        their entanglement with social life is essential if
        we are to take the agencies of such processes
        seriously. During fieldwork, using an assortment
        of methods including walking, seasonal calendars,
        visual methods and sensory witnessing, we learned
        to perceive a multiplicity of monsoonal temporalities
        and temporal slippages from deep time to seasonal
        time to everyday time.

        The landscapes that Chennai, Dhaka and Yangon
        are situated within have been shaped by monsoonal
        forces over the <em>longue duree</em>. Walking these
        landscapes helped us to understand the temporal
        rhythms and material processes that formed them.
        Climbing Mount Popa, a dormant volcano in central
        Myanmar, we observed and felt patterns of erosion
        etched out by successive monsoon seasons under
        our feet. Sediments created through weathering offer
        insights into the earth systems, cycles and rhythms
        that produce monsoon time. By recording these
        rhythms, sedimentary ‘earth archives’ illuminate the
        array of nonhuman forces that shape the monsoon

        Changing atmospheric conditions define the
        seasons that divide the year for societies across
        the globe. South Asian calendars typically divide the
        year into the hot season, the cold season and the
        rainy season, the rains being the pivot of the year.
        During fieldwork in Bangladesh we drew monsoonal
        calendars with farmers, fishers, river nomads, and
        meteorologists. The calendars charted the planting,
        transplanting and harvesting of rice; the lifecycle and
        migrations of hilsa fish; the seasonal flux of rivers
        and breeding cycles of snakes; the meteorological
        seasons and patterns of storms and cyclones.
        Making each calendar revealed a multiplicity of
        human and nonhuman monsoonal attunements.

       <em>Kolam</em> is a daily ritual practiced by Tamil Hindu
        women each morning in the thresholds of houses,

        are drawn with the tips of the fingers using pinches
        of flour held between the thumb and the first finger
        and letting the powder fall in a continuous line.
        Drawing is directed by a grid of pullis or dots that are

        few minutes, but after a few hours, they disappear

        Across the Indian subcontinent monsoonal
        temporalities are changing. These meteorological
        shifts are often subtle and hard to enumerate, but
        they have significant implications for human and
        nonhuman life and the liveability of monsoonal
        cities. Short bursts of intense rain lead to flooding
        because impervious urban environments cannot
        absorb heavy rainfall over compressed timescales.
        Delayed onset and breaks in the monsoon of a week
        or more results in severe water shortages. Rising
        temperatures cause the duration of heatwaves to
        increase, amplifying urban heat island effects. Such

        The monsoon and its cycles are coextensive with
        sediment, formed when seasonal monsoon rains
        rot rock surfaces, dislodge their matter, swirl it
        across landscapes, deposit it on floodplains and
        carry it to the ocean. Here it is pushed around by
        tides and currents and slowly sinks, until, disturbed
        by tectonic forces, it remerges as the folded strata
        of new sedimentary rock. These processes are the
        mechanisms through which the earth recycles itself.
        They transform the monsoon from a weather system
        into a geomorphic agent and undermine the idea
        of terrain as a stable, inert backdrop to the human
        action playing out on, above and under its surfaces.

        "We were also rocks and sediment before we settled

        The earth’s rocks were formed at high temperatures
        and pressures in the swirling magmas of its
        monstrous interior. When thrust up by tectonic
        forces and exposed to the atmosphere, their mineral
        structures become unstable, disintegrate and
        reassemble into other forms more suited to their
        cooler, wetter surroundings. This process, known as
        weathering, materialises not only how earth matter
        weathers its climate, but, also how buildings, bodies
        and all forms of terrestrial life weather the total
        climate of the weather world. <br> <br>

        Once freed from their middle-earth molecular
        strictures, particles of sediment join the weather, so
        to speak. Transported away from their originating
        rock by wind or water, they become dynamic, transcorporeal water bodies, barely distinguishable from
        the dynamics of the flows that carry them. They move
        by what is known as saltation – frolicking, tumbling
        and bouncing along. This mode of mobility transforms
        the particles themselves, the surfaces they move
        over and the flows that move them into turbulent
        assemblages of terra-aqueous matter.

      <p class="copyTextLeft">
        All human habitation of the earth, even when it doesn’t
        entail circumnavigation or other excursions, is a
        kind of journey – a passage through the multi-scalar
        rhythms, singularities and thresholds of a planetary
        surface in motion.<sup>5</sup>
        The forcefulness of this vitality carries with it the
        potential for violent territorial disruption. Dwelling
        alongside mobile terra-aqueous flows requires tuning
        to and working with their fluid becomings, while
        acknowledging their fearsome capacity to undo
        sustaining human connections and footings.

        The fishing village of Chaung Gyi in Myanmar is
        located where the Ayeyarwady River river slows down
        and splits into its delta. At this point, banks and
        shoals constantly shift as the river adjusts its flows.
        Raymonde Bieler, while a student in the Monsoon
        Assemblages studio in 2018, designed a process
        to negotiate with the river to retain sediment as
        ground for a new civic institution for land claims and
        negotiations. The Land Registry, as she called it, was
        sited on the first sedimentary island assembled by her
        ground forming strategy, as a prototype for building in
        terra-aqueous terrain.

        As monsoonal rivers descend to coastal plains, they
        slow down and spread out. They wash over low-lying
        terrain and, as they recede, they leave fertile traces of
        their passing material presence behind. At this point,
        sediment becomes soil and the sciences and politics
        of measure are born. It was the geometricians of
        Egypt, who, in retracing the borders of fields each year
        as the flood waters of the Nile River receded, gave
        rise, in the West, to ideas of politics, property and the
        law. Contrary to conceptions that these ideas were
        conjured up on solid ground, they emerged dripping
        from the alluvial deposits of the Nile, driven by the
        seasonal dynamics of the East African monsoon.

          As sediment settles and sinks, it is subject to
          subterranean pressures and temperatures. Overlying
          layers compact lower layers, slowly squeezing out
          their water content and decreasing their porosity.
          Chemical and structural changes to sediment
          particles, the fluids between them and any organic
          matter buried with them occur. These lively physical
          and geochemical process produce the earth’s stores

        The accompanying pictures are visual glimpses
        of a closed coal-fired power station in New Delhi.
        Alongside its distribution of fly ash and energy into
        the atmosphere, its presence signals the hum of
        industry. Although it’s now closed down, I recollect
        passing by the station on dense, rainy monsoon
        nights, and the glow above the large cooling tower
        would glimmer in eeriness. It distributed a mimetic
        viscerality: volcanoes, boiling water and the work of
        wholesale steam surrounded by the partial darkness
        of the highway. Fly ash conspiracies are both
        atmospheric and terrifying.

        Haze and the unknown
      </h1>

      <p class="copyText">
        The aerosol haze one experiences in places like Delhi
        plays a broad role in disturbing monsoonal rhythms.
        Aerosols increase the complexity of meteorological
        and atmospheric modelling, play a key role in
        influencing the way the monsoon is experienced and
        change monsoonal futures. Contemporary urban
        political discourse privileges the haze as a human
        health hazard. The haze as a material story however
        takes us to a broader set of implications and
        speculative futures that do not just destabilise the
        atmosphere for breathing life-forms but conspire the
        weird and eerie collapse of seasonal thermodynamic
        systems. While being situated within it as a breather
        in pain, the haze is therefore a material interlocutor
        for the unknown, for monsoonal breakdown to come.

      <p class="copyText">
        Placed in a white leaf resin of the areca palm are
        some peppercorns that my grandfather picked
        early one morning during a casual stroll around his
        farm. I had always found it interesting that he never
        spoke of pepper as something that they grew; it just
        happened to be there. Its vines made their presence
        known through their generous embrace of palm
        trees. Black pepper is native to South India and is
        intimately part of its monsoonal ecologies. Pepper
        is a life-form that flourishes in wetness, and climbs
        trees to find the sky. Some of the oldest western
        stories of monsoon winds trace back to the story
        of pepper – its trade, mobility and consumption.
        Monsoon winds bring it into conversations between
        worlds. Pepper occupies a unique interlocutory
        temporality which speaks to the history of wealth,
        culture, trade, extraction, caste, navigation and
        civilisation. Most importantly, pepper is monsoonal.
        It mobilises flavour and stories.

        Migrations
      </h1>

      <p class="copyText">
        To escape the harsh winter in Siberia, Heuglin’s
        gulls migrate to India every year where they can
        be spotted on the Yamuna and Ganga rivers. A
        much loved spot for gull watching in Delhi is on the
        ghats. Ghat is a figure of description that represents
        valleys, passages, forests and embankments. In this
        instance, ghat refers to the steps and platforms on
        the Yamuna River that are also a site of cremation.
        Monsoon rains rejuvenate the river each year,
        increasing the level of oxygen, biotic life and nutrition
        in its waters and producing a favourable environment
        for the gulls. Environmental contamination and
        anthropogenic consumption has impacted this
        annual migration. Yet the monsoon and the Yamuna
        in Delhi, even in its altered state, offer refuge to
        these birds and several other species as part of their
        annual journey south.

        The Yamuna is not only a river but also a deity.
        While scholars have debated the cultural separation
        of rivers between natural, scientific, spiritual and
        more-than-human categories, I want to stay with the
        cosmological idea of the Yamuna as the daughter
        of Surya, the sun. By storying the water of the earth
        as the daughter of the sun, truth telling and story
        telling become wildly interchangeable. My proposal
        is that some generosity and colonial detuning holds
        potential to unpack the work of categories, just
        like the Yamuna which simmers below the city and
        the city which floods the river with industry and
        anthropogenic activity. The cosmological helps to
        understand that a conversation with the Yamuna is
        not too different from the political, economic work
        of treating, contaminating, barraging, polluting,
        damning, bridging, canaling, drilling and mining it.

        are intimately attuned to seasonal rhythms and

        Anthropocene, in the sense that it refuses to be
        uprooted by policy and practice. It simply grows

        it rains in the city, urban materiality vibrates. One

        somewhere. It’s a weird confluence of joy and fear.
        It frames the political conversation of life for days

        While geologists and writers remind us that the
        Himalayas invented the monsoon when they
        emerged eight to sixteen million years ago, in
        contemporary history the upper Himalayan Plateau
        has rarely seen rain. In recent years though, cloud
        bursts in the high altitude region of Ladakh have
        been intensifying during the monsoon, producing
        human disasters in a landscape that isn’t used to
        rain. The changing monsoon climate has also been
        influencing the northward migration of different
        species. The valleys and upper Himalayan Plateau
        are crucial spaces of change that have wide ranging
        effects on the monsoon system. Melting glaciers,
        plantations, military modernity and anthropogenic
        aerosol ecologies are playing important roles in the
        determination of monsoonal futures.

        Yet there is an excess in infrastructural
        assemblages that permits the brokering of new
        relations and affiliations. Water meters can be
        subverted, pipes can be tapped and alternative
        routes to citizenship can coalesce around them.
        For instance, on either side of the main water
        supply pipe from the Gyobyu reservoir into Yangon,
        the eight-meter wide corridor kept open for its
        maintenance and repair has become a bustling
        commons. The pipe itself is used as a footpath by
        those who live alongside it, its materiality becoming
        grounds for insurgent new forms of urban life.

       <em>Ye Gyan Zin</em> is a Burmese tradition of earthenware
        pots filled with potable water and placed in public
        places for passers-by. It is practiced as a charitable
        act of devotion to Buddha and considered to be a
        meritorious deed that will speed up the attainment
        of Nirvana. The practice materialises in distinctively
        shaped clay water pots that are cleaned and filled
        each day by their donors and topped by a wicker,
        metal or plastic cap, accompanied by a ladle, glass

      <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
        The main infrastructural element of <em>Ye Gyan Zin</em>, the
        water pot, is traditionally made in villages along the
        Ayeyarwady River in family-run potteries. A mixture of
        two types of clay is harvested from the banks of the
        river and kneaded into a paste. The pots are shaped on a
        wheel by two people working together, one pumping the
        wheel by foot, the other shaping the clay by hand. Pot
        production is traditionally timed to monsoonal rhythms,
        peaking in the month of Pyatho (late December and
        January) before the hot summer months set in, when
        water charity is most needed. The unglazed pots keep
        water cool through evaporation and those who drink
        from them describe the water as sweet with the taste of
        earth from which they were made.

      <p class="copyText">
        Decay is a building process; it has a chemical slant
        and a differential dynamic distribution. The process
        of decay builds new states of extensity, affect,
        magnitude and even integrity from and out of a system
        or formation without nullifying or reforming it. The
        decaying formation is disposed of its chances to die
        or to live wholesomely, to be abolished, reformed
        or delivered to its origin. For this reason, decay is
        an irresolute process of building that potentiates
        architectures which, while infinitely open to new
        syntheses and transformations, cannot undergo
        complete annulment or return to their original form.<sup>1</sup>

      decay for as long as their benefactors care to sustain

      efflorescence and weeds will return, commemorating
      what could have lasted, or was about to happen,
      but did not. Their unyielding persistence will be a
      potent reminder that buildings are composed of and
      radically open to what surrounds them - air, moisture,
      carbon, salts, chemicals, birds, insects and plants,
      that cohere for only brief moments, and always
      provisionally, into social projects.

        London is the city from where colonial authority
        and racialised discourse were projected across
        monsoonal life-worlds; where colonial science
        developed empirics that cast monsoonal
        temporalities as risk and radically reorganised
        monsoonal territories for profit; where the legacies
        of colonialism are still palpable – in the India Office

        South Indian tanks, known as <em>eris</em> in Tamil, are ancient
        earthworks designed to harvest monsoon rainwater.
        These agentive socio-natural structures have mediated
        relations between people and the monsoon since
        medieval times.

        <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
          Tanks were an emergent response to the landscape
          and weather of the Tamil Nadu coastal plains. The
          landscape is hot and dry, characterised by scant
          rainfall, high temperatures and thorny vegetation.
          Due to the aridity of the region, early South Indian
          kingdoms relied on the effective control of water.
          Tanks were designed to capture and store seasonal
          flows of monsoon rainwater. Approximately 39,000
          interconnected tanks were constructed over
          centuries, radically altering the regional landscape
          and its hydrology.

          <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
            Tamil Nadu lies in the rain shadow of the Western
            Ghats, a chain of mountains which block rainfall
            from the southwest monsoon from reaching it. Tanks
            were created to store rain brought by the northeast
            monsoon. Construction of <em>eris</em> proliferated during
            the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 850-1300), which
            saw an increase in northeast monsoon rainfall. The
            curved earthen embankments encouraged rainwater
            to percolate, soak and seep into the ground, retaining
            the monsoon within the landscape and extending its
            presence for longer.

              By promoting a moisture-laden atmosphere, tanks
              altered the regional climate. Tank infrastructures
              influenced humidity and air flow, cooling ambient
              temperatures and inducing localised rainfall. Each
              tank created a microclimate and their accumulated
              effects altered the broader macroclimate of
              the region. By leveraging the monsoon, tank
              infrastructures enabled wet paddy rice cultivation
              which prompted dramatic population growth and the
              emergence of cities, towns and temples.

                Over time, tanks transitioned into new socio-political

                the 1800s describe its landscape as comprised of
                an abundance of tanks. During the course of urban
                expansion many tanks were filled in or encroached
                on to create land for buildings and infrastructure.

                  Despite being part of highly urbanised landscapes,
                  tanks foster a diversity of human and nonhuman life.
                  Tanks offer opportunity space for the marginalised
                  and those with precarious livelihoods. They provide
                  habitat for fish to breed and nurse, and host native
                  and migratory birds whose movements respond
                  to changing weather patterns. Their earthen
                  embankments provide niches for plants, trees and
                  medicinal herbs that once formed part of agricultural
                  systems. Tank ecologies reveal complex webs of
                  interconnection across time and space.

                    Chennai’s remaining tanks are undergoing
                    radical transformation as part of restoration and
                    beautification initiatives. Environmentalists are
                    concerned that tanks are being redesigned as
                    ‘tubs’ or ‘buckets’ for compounding or containing
                    water. This reconceptualisation is influenced by
                    the prevalence of a ‘blue water bias’ that prioritises
                    surface water. Such understandings contrast
                    markedly with older conceptions of tanks as ‘rain
                    infrastructure’ that encourage many forms of
                    wetness, including wetness in the soil and in the air.

        Chennai’s water system is multiple and distributed,
        with only a fraction coming from the municipal piped
        supply. The role of groundwater as a resource that
        can be drawn from to meet this shortfall is deeply
        ingrained in the urban imagination. Groundwater
        provides a crucial means of storage, safe from
        evaporation and surface run off, that can be used
        to slow the outward flow of seasonal rainfall and
        make it accessible throughout the year. Groundwater
        abstraction occurs both within domestic plots and
        on a commercial scale from agricultural areas
        outside of the city. The reliance upon groundwater
        for the region’s liveability is reflected in the statewide rainwater harvesting programme to direct
        rainfall into the ground via percolation structures.

        Working with groundwater requires working across

        in increasingly complex digital models to simulate

          Throughout the project we have used ethnographic
          methods to engage with the monsoon as an earth
          system vastly distributed in time and space, whilst
          exploring the many ways in which monsoonal
          weather becomes entangled within urban
          environments. While ethnographic ways of working
          with meteorological phenomena are still emerging,
          finding ways to attune to the agentive capacities of
          weather is vital in light of uncertain futures.

            To engage with the monsoon in the context of three
            megacities, we took inspiration from multi-sited
            ethnography which follows people, connections,
            associations and relationships across space and
            time. Although we were aware that ‘fields’ are
            not bounded or static, nor exclusively human,
            the monsoonal framing of the project extended
            our attention beyond grounded sites to include
            atmospheric conditions. It forced us to consider how
            to explore each of the cities in relation to monsoonal
            dynamics that move through and connect spaces
            and places, surround and encompass them, whilst
            becoming tangled up and folded within them.
            Monsoonal paths, threads, conjunctions and
            juxtapositions emerged which formed logics of
            association and connections between sites.

              Embarking on the first phase of fieldwork we had
              a very limited sense of how the monsoon was
              conceptualised and understood by people residing
              in the three cities. Initial attempts to explore people’s
              weather-worlds involved talking with meteorologists,
              academics, environmental activists, architects,
              planners, and urban dwellers from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Initial conversations
              about the monsoon in Chennai encompassed
              the traditional Tamil calendar, meteorological
              seasons and changing meteorological terminology,
              the personalities and characteristics of different
              monsoonal phases and suggestions that
              monsoon might be a colonial concept. These
              conversations revealed the diversity of human
              attempts to comprehend and make sense of this
              complex meteorological phenomenon and their
              entanglements over time.

                For the next phase of fieldwork, we focused less
                on knowledge about the monsoon and more on
                what monsoon weather does. This was an attempt
                to move away from perspectives that framed the
                monsoon as a resource to be leveraged or a problem
                to be managed, and was informed by observations of
                generative monsoonal qualities, forces, rhythms and
                movements and their entanglements within human
                and nonhuman life-worlds. We began to perceive
                the places we visited as dynamic choreographies
                between bodies, matter and weather. By focusing on
                the life-ways of nonhuman species and by following
                material registers of the monsoon we gained an
                understanding of how monsoon weather creates
                ecologies and generates material processes. These
                explorations highlighted the monsoon as a dynamic
                spatio-temporal creator of life.

                <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
                  Monsoon Assemblages was framed politically
                  with an explicit focus on the influence of human
                  activities, particularly rapid urban growth, on
                  monsoon climates. Fieldwork in each city drew us
                  to particular sites of urban expansion, revealing
                  landscapes of accumulation and the geopolitical and
                  macro economic dynamics driving urban growth.
                  Work on water infrastructures and processes of
                  encroachment made us aware of the inequities and
                  power dynamics at play within urban landscapes.
                  Monsoonal materials drew attention to insatiable
                  urban appetites for soil, sediment and water and the
                  role that cities play in driving extractive processes.
                  Following monsoonal species we sensed the impact
                  that rapidly expanding built environments are having
                  on nonhuman worlds. Throughout the research it
                  was clear that monsoon weather is political.

                  fragments to form a partial and incomplete
                  patchwork. The journey has been personal,
                  transformational and contingent, responsive to
                  the excesses, complexities and entanglements of
                  monsoonal life-worlds. The monsoon has played
                  an active role throughout, shaping and informing
                  the process. Following the monsoon has opened
                  avenues we may not otherwise have explored,
                  forged connections between things we may have
                  considered in isolation, and expanded our fields of
                  perception beyond grounded happenings to include
                  atmospheric concerns.
